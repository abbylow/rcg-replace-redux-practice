This is the hand-on practice of React Complete Guide Tutorial (by Academind, on Udemy)

Other than Redux, we can use Context API and Custom hook to handle the state management. 

Context API: 
Only use for low frequency update, eg: Auth status, Theming.

Use custom hook to manage state (simulate how Redux works):
Can use for high frequency update, also able to share the state between different components (by creating the state outside of the hook)
